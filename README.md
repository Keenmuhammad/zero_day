## Vagrant optional

## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Using Vagrant on your personal computer (https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/81)

## Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer
Sandboxes are great, but you can also do your ALX assessments on your local computer - having a virtual machine (VM) is the perfect tool for that.

Let’s dig into Vagrant today!

Also:

This project is 100% optional
This project can’t be done in Sandboxes - it can be done only in your local computer.

## Resources 

Virtual machine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)
man uname (https://linux.die.net/man/1/uname)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:


What is a virtual machine
What is Vagrant
Who wrote Vagrant
What is Ubuntu
What does “Ubuntu” mean
How to use VMs with Vagrant
What does the command uname do

## Tasks

Task 0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account

You will need Git for this project, you might have to install it on your computer if it’s not done yet.

Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine – they will be part of your commits. Tips
On GitHub.com:

Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository (if it’s not done yet)
Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
Public repo: zero_day
No README, .gitignore, or license
On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

Navigate to your home directory. Tips
Create a directory zero_day. Tips
Navigate to this new directory. Tips
Initialize git and add the remote origin
Create a file README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. This file is mandatory in projects
Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
Good job!

You pushed your first file in your first repository of the first task of your first School project.

Task 1. Hello Ubuntu

Inside the zero_day repo, create a new directory called 0x00-vagrant. Add a README.md file to this directory.

ssh into your Ubuntu VM. What does the command uname print when you run it without any option?

Type your answer into a file in the 0x00-vagrant directory and push it to GitHub. Name your file accordingly as shown below.
